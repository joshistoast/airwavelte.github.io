    <h3>AirWaveLTE’s Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. As part of the operation of AirWave’s web site
      (“www.AirWavelte.com”)
      and broadband Internet service, we gather certain types of information from users, and we would like to explain
      the
      types of information we gather, what we do with them, and how to correct or change the information. The privacy
      policies
      for www.AirWavelte.com also apply to any other websites of AirWave Digital, Inc.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Information Collected by AirWavelte.com</h3>
    <p>AirWavelte.com collects two types of information from users: personal data such as your name, physical address,
      e-mail
      address, or credit card information (in the case of payments for service or equipment); and aggregated data such
      as
      information about traffic patterns on www.AirWavelte.com (for example, how many users log on to www.AirWavelte.com
      on a
      daily basis), or traffic patterns and data consumption rates via AirWaveLTE broadband service.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Aggregated Information</h3>
    <p>Aggregated information, such as which pages users visit, is collected through various means. One of these ways is
      through an IP (“Internet Protocol”) address, a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
      are
      surfing the Web. Web servers (the computers that store the files of Web pages that Internet users visit)
      automatically
      identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from www.AirWavelte.com, the site’s servers
      record
      your IP address. The IP address is not linked to anything personally identifiable, so although IP information is
      available, personal identity remains anonymous.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>Our website employs security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information
      under our
      control. We use a secure server to protect the security of online credit card transactions. Furthermore, all of
      the
      visitor data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. AirWave’s employees understand the need for user
      privacy and access to user data is strictly limited. Your credit card and/or bank information is not stored on our
      systems. We only trust and utilize third party vendors with state-of-the-art encryption and security protocols
      with that
      information.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Use of Information Collected by AirWavelte.com</h3>
    <p>We may use personal information in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To send e-mail acknowledgements of orders or correspondence conducted on the website and or social media
        platforms.</li>
      <li>To send you e-mail billing or service notices.</li>
      <li>To enhance existing features or develop new features and services.</li>
      <li>To process payments.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <p>When you use www.AirWavelte.com, you consent to our collection and use of the personal information you provide.
      AirWave
      does not disclose personally identifying information about its users to others without their consent. Please note
      that
      if at any time AirWave is required by law or a legal process to release individual or organizational information,
      we
      must cooperate fully.</p>

    <p>If you ever wish to be removed from any mailing lists of AirWave, to change your personal information that we
      have on
      file, or to learn what information about you we have on file, please send your request to the postal or e-mail
      addresses
      listed above, or contact us at the telephone number listed above.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
    <p>It is important to note that www.AirWavelte.com may contain links to sites other than www.AirWavelte.com, and
